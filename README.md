# Guitar Pro Song Launcher
This is a personal project I made to make it easy to launch song files with [Guitar Pro](https://www.guitar-pro.com).

As a guitarist, I simply want to play music while maximize my practice time. I use the highly recommended program __Guitar Pro__ extensively while practicing, as I have thousands of songs available, but I seem to waste a lot of time searching for the next song to play. To make matters worse, my files were disorganized and spread out through many directories.

## Introducing Guitar Pro Song Launcher

I built a simple Electron app that displays all of my songs in an easy to navigate list, which opens the file in the Guitar Pro program when clicked. Although quite basic at the moment, I plan on adding search and filtering features in the near future to make it even easier to navigate through all of these songs.
